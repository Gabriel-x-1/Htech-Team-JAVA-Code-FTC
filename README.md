# Htech Team JAVA Code FTC

This repository contains the Java code developed by the Htech robotics team to control and program their robot during the First Tech Challenge (FTC) competition. The code includes features such as precise mecanum wheel movement, linear actuator and sliding mechanism programming, custom-made grippers using dc and servo motors, and camera object detection.

The Htech team programmed their robot using Java, a versatile and widely used programming language in robotics. Java allowed them to write efficient code that controlled the robot's movements and interactions with the environment during the competition.

Additionally, the code can be integrated with other hardware and software solutions to create a complete robotics system for the competition. The team used encoders for precise movement and implemented logic for the robot to perform specific tasks during the FTC competition.
# Usage

To use this code, clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-x-1/Htech-Team-JAVA-Code-FTC.git. Then, open the Java files in an IDE of your choice, review and understand the code, and implement it in your robot's system.
